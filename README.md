# Description
For this assingment, I created a game. The game is called "Space Shooter". I created it using the Java language on the Eclipse IDE, using Processing libraries. 
When the player starts the program, they are greeted by an intro screen, which gives instructions to the user, and also gives them the option to either start playing or change the settings. 
The aim of the game is to shoot the green blocks to increase score, and to avoid the red enemies which cause your score to decrease. The player controls a spacship which shoots bullets, and can be moved using WASD controls, using the space bar to fire.
If the player's score drops below zero, it's Game Over. However, as the player's score increases, the player moves to increasingly difficult levels. If the player's score get high enough, you win the game.
