# Description
## For this assingment, I created a game. The game is called "Space Shooter". I created it using the Java language on the Eclipse IDE, using Processing libraries. The aim of the game is to shoot the green blocks to increase score, and to avoid the red enemies which cause your score to decrease. The player controls a spacship which shoots bullets, and can be moved using WASD controls, using the space bar to fire.
